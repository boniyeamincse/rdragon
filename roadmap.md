# ReconDragon Development Roadmap

## Phase List

### Phase 1: Project Initialization and Planning

**Goal:** Establish a solid foundation for ReconDragon development.

**Deliverables:**
- Project structure and repository setup
- Technology stack selection (Python, CLI framework, web UI library)
- Initial requirements document and module specifications

**Success Criteria:**
- Clear project scope defined
- Architecture diagram completed
- Development environment configured

### Phase 2: Core Framework Development

**Goal:** Build the extensible CLI framework with module loading capabilities.

**Deliverables:**
- Core CLI application with command structure
- Plugin/module loading system
- Configuration management system

**Success Criteria:**
- CLI accepts basic commands and loads modules
- At least one sample module integrates successfully

### Phase 3: Module Development

**Goal:** Implement core reconnaissance modules.

**Deliverables:**
- DNS enumeration module
- Port scanning module
- Web directory brute-forcing module
- Additional modules (e.g., subdomain enumeration, service detection)

**Success Criteria:**
- 5+ modules implemented and functional
- Modules produce accurate, actionable output

### Phase 4: Web UI Development

**Goal:** Add optional web interface for enhanced usability.

**Deliverables:**
- RESTful API for scan operations
- Basic web dashboard for scan initiation and results viewing

**Success Criteria:**
- Web UI can trigger scans and display results
- API supports core CLI functionality

### Phase 5: Testing and Security Hardening

**Goal:** Ensure reliability, performance, and security.

**Deliverables:**
- Comprehensive test suite (unit, integration)
- Security audit and vulnerability assessment
- Performance optimizations

**Success Criteria:**
- All tests pass with >80% coverage
- No critical security vulnerabilities identified

### Phase 6: Documentation and Release

**Goal:** Prepare ReconDragon for public release.

**Deliverables:**
- User documentation and API reference
- Installation and usage guides
- Release packaging and distribution setup

**Success Criteria:**
- Project can be installed and run by external users
- Documentation covers all key features

Total estimated effort for MVP: ~52 days (single developer)

## Risk & Mitigation Table

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Legal compliance issues from unauthorized scanning | Include prominent disclaimers, require explicit consent flags, provide legal checklist in README |
| Security vulnerabilities in custom or third-party code | Conduct regular security audits, use dependency scanning tools, follow secure coding practices |
| Performance bottlenecks during large-scale scans | Implement rate limiting, async operations, and resource monitoring; optimize algorithms |
| Inaccurate or harmful module outputs | Add input validation, output sanitization, and user warnings for potentially destructive modules |
| Low user adoption due to poor usability | Focus on intuitive CLI design, comprehensive documentation, and community engagement |
| Scope creep adding unnecessary features | Maintain strict MVP focus, prioritize core functionality, use agile planning with fixed milestones |

## Minimum Viable Authorization/Legal Checklist

### Legal and Ethical Usage Checklist

Before using ReconDragon, ensure compliance with the following:

- Obtain explicit written permission from target owners before conducting any reconnaissance activities.
- Restrict usage to authorized systems and networks only.
- Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and terms of service in your jurisdiction.
- Avoid scanning government, critical infrastructure, or sensitive systems without proper authorization.
- Do not use ReconDragon for malicious purposes, including unauthorized access or disruption.
- Respect robots.txt and rate limits when interacting with web targets.
- Understand that the tool authors are not responsible for misuse.

If in doubt, consult legal counsel.
